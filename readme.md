#bradtraversy-project collection

This repo will be dedicated to all the projects I've done from Brad Traversy's tutorials. I absolutely love his stuff and the way he teaches. These projects are both from his courses and youtube video, both of which feature a lot of overwhelming content. He goes over everything in great detail and always opens your eyes to new things. 

##bradtraversy-todotask-app (modern-js)

The code is fairly similar to what he gives us, I've done a slight modification to the JavaScript to minimize code duplication with es6 arrow functions. 

Interesting features: 
* The filter function uses CSS display to show/hide results.
* Shows how while loop is faster than clearing the innerHTML.
* Uses DOMContentLoaded to trigger task loading.

The web app can be viewed **[here](https://w3althambition.github.io/bradtraversy-todotask-app)**.

##bradtraversy-loan-calc-app

The description for this project is the same as the one above. 

Interesting features:
* Error HTML object template injected into the dom.
* Timeout looks to remove the error by class lookup.

The web app can be viewed **[here](https://w3althambition.github.io/bradtraversy-loan-calc-app/)**.
